/* object.h - type definition for ObjectType
 *
 * An object is the basic building block for anything that will be
 * part of the world. Every block, wall, character, and the player
 * all have Objects in them. However, blocks are JUST an object,
 * while something like a character CONTAINS a block.
 *
 * The ObjectType is used to create a type of object. Every type
 * of object has the same spritesheet and animations. The ObjectType holds a
 * list of rectangles as well - these represent each instance of the object.
 * For example, an ObjectType called 'brick' can be created, loading the
 * spritesheet and animations, and then a list of bricks can be created. Each
 * brick itself is just a location (x,y) and size (width,height). The
 * ObjectType holds the rest. This allows for the creation of only a single
 * ObjectType - the brick - and the creation of an infinite (providing memory)
 * amount of bricks.
 *
 * Since the ObjectType holds a list of objects, and an object
