/* character.h - type definition for CharacterType and CHaracter

 * Characters work very similarly to objects, and are really just
 * one level higher than them - they are simply objects that also move.
 * CharacterTypes are made, and they essentially have an ObjectType,
 * and traits specific to the character, such as if they are affected
 * by gravity.
